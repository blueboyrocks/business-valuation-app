# 10-Factor Risk Assessment Framework

## Overview

This framework evaluates business risk across 10 key dimensions. Each factor is scored 1-5:
- **1** = Very Low Risk (premium position)
- **2** = Low Risk (above average)
- **3** = Moderate Risk (average)
- **4** = High Risk (below average)
- **5** = Very High Risk (significant concerns)

The weighted average determines the overall risk profile and drives multiple adjustments.

## Factor 1: Revenue Concentration (Weight: 12%)

**What to Assess**: Customer dependency and revenue diversification

| 5 | Largest customer > 40%; extreme dependency |

**Red Flags**:
- Single customer represents majority of revenue

## Calculating Overall Risk Score

```
Overall Risk Score = Σ (Factor Score × Factor Weight)

Example:
Factor 1 (Revenue Conc.): 3 × 0.12 = 0.36
Factor 2 (Owner Dep.):    4 × 0.15 = 0.60
Factor 3 (Records):       2 × 0.12 = 0.24
Factor 4 (Industry):      2 × 0.10 = 0.20
Factor 5 (Competition):   3 × 0.10 = 0.30
Factor 6 (Growth):        3 × 0.10 = 0.30
Factor 7 (Assets):        2 × 0.08 = 0.16
Factor 8 (Geographic):    2 × 0.08 = 0.16
Factor 9 (Regulatory):    3 × 0.08 = 0.24
Factor 10 (Economic):     3 × 0.07 = 0.21
                                     -----
TOTAL:                              2.77
```
