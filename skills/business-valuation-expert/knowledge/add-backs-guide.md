# Add-Backs Guide for SDE/EBITDA Normalization

## Understanding Add-Backs

Add-backs are adjustments made to reported earnings to reflect the true economic benefit available to an owner/buyer. They normalize one-time, non-operating, and discretionary expenses.

## Standard SDE Add-Backs

### 1. Owner Compensation Adjustment
**Always Add Back**: Total owner compensation above market rate

**Calculation**:
- Total owner compensation (salary + benefits + perks)
- MINUS reasonable market salary for the role
- EQUALS add-back amount

**Market Salary Benchmarks** (depends on business size/industry):
| Revenue Range | Typical Market Salary |
|--------------|----------------------|
| < $500K | $50,000 - $75,000 |
| $500K - $1M | $75,000 - $100,000 |
| $1M - $2M | $100,000 - $125,000 |
| $2M - $5M | $125,000 - $175,000 |
| $5M+ | $150,000 - $250,000 |

### 2. Depreciation & Amortization
**Always Add Back**: 100% of depreciation and amortization
- Reported on Form 4562
- Non-cash expense
- Included in both SDE and EBITDA calculations

### 3. Interest Expense
**Add Back for EBITDA**: All interest expense
**May Add Back for SDE**: If related to owner-financed equipment/real estate

### 4. Rent to Related Parties
**Add Back If**: Rent paid exceeds market rate
- Common when owner owns real estate separately
- Add back the difference between paid rent and market rent
- Note: May need to ADD expense if rent is below market

### 5. Non-Recurring Expenses

| Expense Type | Add Back? | Typical Amount |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Legal fees (one-time litigation) | Yes | Full amount |
| Relocation costs | Yes | Full amount |
| Natural disaster repairs | Yes | Full amount |
| One-time marketing campaigns | Yes | Full amount |
| Severance payments | Yes | Full amount |
| Equipment write-offs | Yes | Full amount |
| Bad debt (unusual) | Yes | Excess over normal |

### 6. Discretionary Owner Expenses

| Expense Type | Add Back? | Confidence |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Owner's personal vehicle | Partial | High |
| Owner's cell phone | Yes | High |
| Owner's health insurance | Yes | High |
| Owner's life insurance | Yes | High |
| Travel (mixed business/personal) | 50% | Medium |
| Meals & entertainment | 50% | Medium |
| Dues & subscriptions (personal) | Yes | High |
| Education (owner only) | Yes | Medium |
| Home office (personal residence) | Yes | Medium |

### 7. Non-Operating Income/Expenses

**Add Back (or Subtract)**:
- Investment income (subtract if adding)
- Rental income from non-business property
- Gains/losses on asset sales
- Foreign exchange gains/losses

### 8. Family Employee Compensation
**Add Back If**: Family members are overpaid
- Spouse salary above market
- Children/relatives on payroll but not working full-time
- Calculate excess over market rate for actual work performed

## EBITDA-Specific Add-Backs

EBITDA starts with Net Income and adds back:
1. Interest (all forms)
2. Taxes (income taxes only)
3. Depreciation
4. Amortization

Additional EBITDA adjustments often include:
- One-time items (same as SDE)
- Non-cash stock compensation
- Management fees to related parties
- Below-market rent (add expense)

## Add-Back Documentation Requirements

For each add-back, document:
1. **Category**: What type of add-back
2. **Amount**: Specific dollar amount
3. **Justification**: Why it's appropriate
4. **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low
5. **Supporting Evidence**: Where found in documents

## Example SDE Calculation

```
Reported Net Income:                    $150,000

ADD-BACKS:
+ Owner salary (excess over market)     $75,000
+ Owner health insurance                $18,000
+ Owner auto expenses                   $8,000
+ Depreciation                          $45,000
+ One-time legal fees                   $15,000
+ Personal travel                       $5,000
+ Life insurance (owner)                $4,000
                                        --------
Total Add-Backs:                        $170,000

NORMALIZED SDE:                         $320,000
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Double-counting**: Don't add back depreciation twice (it's already in EBITDA)
2. **Missing obvious items**: Always check for owner comp, depreciation, interest
3. **Over-aggressive add-backs**: Personal expenses must be documented
4. **Ignoring negative adjustments**: Sometimes expenses need to be added, not subtracted
5. **Not adjusting for market rate**: Owner salary must be compared to market
6. **Forgetting multi-year analysis**: Use weighted average for volatile businesses

## Confidence Levels for Add-Backs

**High Confidence** (100% add-back):
- Depreciation/amortization
- Owner salary above market
- One-time legal/professional fees
- Documented personal expenses

**Medium Confidence** (75% add-back):
- Travel with mixed purposes
- Meals and entertainment
- Family employee wages

**Low Confidence** (50% add-back or exclude):
- Undocumented "personal" expenses
- Estimated personal use percentages
- Unverifiable claims
