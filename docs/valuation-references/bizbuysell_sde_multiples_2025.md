## How to Apply These Multiples

### Step 1: Calculate SDE
Start with net income and add back:
- Owner's salary and benefits
- Depreciation and amortization
- Interest expense
- One-time or non-recurring expenses
- Personal expenses run through the business

### Step 2: Select Appropriate Multiple
Consider factors that adjust the multiple up or down:

**Factors that INCREASE the multiple:**
- Strong revenue growth (>10% annually)
- Diversified customer base
- Recurring revenue streams
- Strong management team (not owner-dependent)
- Modern equipment and facilities
- Prime location with long lease
- Clean financial records

**Factors that DECREASE the multiple:**
- Customer concentration (>20% from one customer)
- Owner dependence
- Declining revenue
- Old equipment requiring replacement
- Short lease or unfavorable terms
- Industry headwinds
- Incomplete financial records

### Step 3: Calculate Value Range
- **Low estimate**: SDE × (Industry Multiple - 0.5)
- **Mid estimate**: SDE × Industry Multiple
- **High estimate**: SDE × (Industry Multiple + 0.5)

### Example Calculation
- Business: Auto Repair Shop
- Annual SDE: $180,000
- Industry SDE Multiple: 2.83x
- Adjustments: Strong customer base (+0.2), older equipment (-0.3)
- Adjusted Multiple: 2.83 + 0.2 - 0.3 = 2.73x
- Estimated Value: $180,000 × 2.73 = $491,400
