# Risk Assessment Framework for Business Valuation

## Overview

Risk assessment is critical for determining appropriate valuation multiples. This framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating company-specific risk factors that affect business value.

---

## Company-Specific Risk Premium (CSRP)

The CSRP adjusts the valuation multiple up or down based on factors unique to the subject company. A higher risk score results in a lower multiple (and thus lower value).

### Risk Scoring Scale

| Score | Risk Level | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Very Low | Exceptional strength, minimal concerns |
| 2 | Low | Above average, minor concerns |
| 3 | Moderate | Industry average, typical concerns |
| 4 | High | Below average, significant concerns |
| 5 | Very High | Major weakness, serious concerns |

---

## Risk Factor Categories

### 1. Size Risk (Weight: 15%)

Smaller businesses carry more risk due to limited resources, less diversification, and higher vulnerability to market changes.

| Annual Revenue | Score | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| > $5 million | 1 | Substantial scale, multiple revenue streams |
| $2-5 million | 2 | Solid mid-market business |
| $1-2 million | 3 | Typical small business |
| $500K-1 million | 4 | Limited scale, vulnerable |
| < $500K | 5 | Micro-business, high risk |

**Additional Size Considerations:**
- Number of employees
- Number of locations
- Geographic reach
- Market share in local area

### 2. Customer Concentration (Weight: 15%)

Dependence on a small number of customers creates significant risk if any customer is lost.

| Largest Customer % of Revenue | Score | Rationale |
|------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| < 5% | 1 | Highly diversified |
| 5-10% | 2 | Well diversified |
| 10-20% | 3 | Moderate concentration |
| 20-35% | 4 | Significant concentration |
| > 35% | 5 | Dangerous concentration |

**Additional Concentration Considerations:**
- Top 5 customers as % of revenue
- Customer contract terms
- Customer relationship longevity
- Industry of key customers
- Likelihood of customer loss in transition

### 3. Owner Dependence (Weight: 15%)

Businesses heavily reliant on the owner's skills, relationships, or involvement are riskier for buyers.

| Owner Involvement Level | Score | Rationale |
|------------------------|-------|-----------|
| Fully absentee with strong management | 1 | Business runs independently |
| Semi-absentee with capable manager | 2 | Owner involved 10-20 hrs/week |
| Owner manages but has key employees | 3 | Owner involved 30-40 hrs/week |
| Owner is primary producer/salesperson | 4 | Owner critical to operations |
| Owner IS the business | 5 | Business cannot function without owner |

**Key Questions:**
- Does owner have key customer relationships?
- Does owner possess unique skills/certifications?
- How long would transition take?
- Are there documented systems and procedures?
- Could a buyer step in immediately?

### 4. Management Depth (Weight: 10%)

Strong management teams reduce risk and enable growth.

| Management Quality | Score | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Experienced management team, succession plan | 1 | Institutional quality |
| Strong #2 who could run business | 2 | Good depth |
| Capable managers in key roles | 3 | Adequate coverage |
| Limited management, owner handles most | 4 | Thin management |
| No management team, owner does everything | 5 | Single point of failure |

**Assessment Factors:**
- Years of experience of key managers
- Management turnover rate
- Documented job descriptions
- Cross-training and backup coverage
- Incentive/retention programs

### 5. Financial Record Quality (Weight: 10%)

Clean, complete financial records reduce due diligence risk and increase buyer confidence.

| Financial Record Quality | Score | Rationale |
|-------------------------|-------|-----------|
| Audited financials, clean records | 1 | Highest confidence |
| Reviewed financials, good records | 2 | Strong documentation |
| Compiled financials, adequate records | 3 | Acceptable |
| Tax returns only, some gaps | 4 | Limited visibility |
| Poor records, cash business | 5 | Significant uncertainty |

**Quality Indicators:**
- Type of financial statements (audited/reviewed/compiled)
- Consistency between tax returns and internal records
- Completeness of supporting documentation
- Quality of accounting system
- Timeliness of financial reporting

### 6. Industry Outlook (Weight: 10%)

Industry trends significantly impact future performance and value.

| Industry Outlook | Score | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| High growth, favorable trends | 1 | Strong tailwinds |
| Moderate growth, stable outlook | 2 | Positive trajectory |
| Mature, stable industry | 3 | Predictable |
| Declining or disrupted industry | 4 | Headwinds |
| Severe decline, major disruption | 5 | Existential threats |

**Industry Factors:**
- Historical growth rate
- Projected growth rate
- Technological disruption risk
- Regulatory changes
- Competitive dynamics
- Barriers to entry

### 7. Competitive Position (Weight: 10%)

Strong competitive positioning provides pricing power and customer retention.

| Competitive Position | Score | Rationale |
|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| Market leader, strong brand | 1 | Dominant position |
| Strong competitor, differentiated | 2 | Competitive advantage |
| Solid competitor, some differentiation | 3 | Holding position |

**Competitive Factors:**
- Market share
- Brand recognition
- Customer loyalty/retention
- Pricing power
- Unique products/services
- Proprietary technology/IP
- Location advantages

### 8. Geographic Concentration (Weight: 5%)

Dependence on a single geographic area increases vulnerability to local economic conditions.

| Geographic Reach | Score | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| National/international presence | 1 | Highly diversified |
| Multi-state/regional | 2 | Good diversification |
| Multi-location, single metro | 3 | Moderate concentration |
| Single location, good market | 4 | Local dependence |
| Single location, weak market | 5 | High local risk |

### 9. Supplier Dependence (Weight: 5%)

Reliance on key suppliers creates supply chain risk.

| Supplier Situation | Score | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Multiple suppliers, no concentration | 1 | Highly diversified |
| Primary supplier with alternatives | 2 | Manageable risk |
| Key supplier, some alternatives | 3 | Moderate risk |
| Dependent on 1-2 suppliers | 4 | Significant risk |
| Single source, no alternatives | 5 | Critical vulnerability |

### 10. Regulatory Risk (Weight: 5%)

| Standard business regulations | 2 | Normal requirements |
| Moderate industry regulation | 3 | Manageable compliance |

- Environmental regulations
- Health and safety requirements
- Industry-specific regulations
- Pending regulatory changes
- Compliance history

## Risk Score Calculation

### Weighted Risk Score Formula

```
Weighted Risk Score = Σ (Factor Score × Factor Weight)

Example:
Size Risk:              3 × 0.15 = 0.45
Customer Concentration: 2 × 0.15 = 0.30
Owner Dependence:       4 × 0.15 = 0.60
Management Depth:       3 × 0.10 = 0.30
Financial Records:      2 × 0.10 = 0.20
Industry Outlook:       3 × 0.10 = 0.30
Competitive Position:   3 × 0.10 = 0.30
Geographic Concentration: 4 × 0.05 = 0.20
Supplier Dependence:    2 × 0.05 = 0.10
Regulatory Risk:        2 × 0.05 = 0.10
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Weighted Score:              2.85
```

### Score Interpretation

| Weighted Score | Risk Category | Multiple Adjustment |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1.0 - 1.5 | Low Risk | +0.5 to +1.0x |
| 1.5 - 2.0 | Below Average Risk | +0.25 to +0.5x |
| 2.0 - 2.5 | Average Risk | No adjustment |
| 2.5 - 3.0 | Above Average Risk | -0.25 to -0.5x |
| 3.0 - 3.5 | Elevated Risk | -0.5 to -0.75x |
| 3.5 - 4.0 | High Risk | -0.75 to -1.0x |
| 4.0 - 5.0 | Very High Risk | -1.0x or more |
