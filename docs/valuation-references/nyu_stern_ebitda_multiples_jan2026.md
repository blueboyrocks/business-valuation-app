## Important Notes for Business Valuation

These multiples are derived from **publicly traded companies** and must be adjusted for small private businesses:
- Small business discount: Typically 30-50% lower multiples than public companies
- Liquidity discount: Additional 15-25% for lack of marketability
- Size premium: Smaller companies command lower multiples

## Converting Public Company Multiples to Small Business Multiples

For businesses with SDE/EBITDA under $1 million, apply these adjustments:

### Size Discount Table
| Annual EBITDA | Typical Discount from Public Multiple |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Under $250K | 60-70% discount |
| $250K - $500K | 50-60% discount |
| $500K - $1M | 40-50% discount |
| $1M - $2.5M | 30-40% discount |
| $2.5M - $5M | 20-30% discount |
| $5M - $10M | 10-20% discount |
| Over $10M | 0-10% discount |

### Example Calculation
- Industry: Restaurant/Dining
- Public company EV/EBITDA: 17.49x
- Small restaurant EBITDA: $300,000
- Size discount: 55%
- Adjusted multiple: 17.49 × (1 - 0.55) = 7.87x
- Implied value: $300,000 × 7.87 = $2,361,000

This aligns with typical small restaurant SDE multiples of 2.0-3.0x (which translate to EBITDA multiples of approximately 6-10x after owner compensation adjustments).
